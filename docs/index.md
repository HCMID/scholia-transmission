## Manuscripts 

Our team worked on editing Book 8 of the Burney 86 and Venetus B Manuscripts. 

### Burney 86 

The Burney 86 is a 11th century manuscript with four distinct zones of scholia (main, interior, interlinear and intermarginal) and contains content not seen in other manuscripts from the same time period.

### Venetus B 

The Venetus B is an 11th century manuscript with main scholia and isolated instances of scholia in other zones. The content of it's text and scholia is nearly identical to another 11th century manuscript, the Upsilon 1.1, such that they are refered to as the "Twins" and are believed to come from a common source.

## Homer MultiText Project

The Homer Multitext Project is an ongoing collaboration between several institutions, including Holy Cross, University of Houston, Furman University, and Leiden Univeristy in the Netherlands. It aims to create diplomatic digital editions of the manuscripts of the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey* that account for their origins in a robust oral tradition. The HMT Project published a complete of the Venetus A, the oldest surviving manuscript of the *Iliad*, in 2017.
